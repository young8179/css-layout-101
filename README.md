## 1. Absolute

Use `position: absolute;` along with percentage units

## 2. Floats

Use `float` and `clear`. You might need to use the "clearfix" trick and some extra `div`'s here and there to get it right

## 3. Flex Box

Use `display: flex` to achieve the layout

## 4. CSS Grid

Use the `display: grid` CSS module
